## Style Guidelines:

- Background: Muted dark background (#0B0F14) to mimic a retro terminal.
- Accents: Electric cyan (#00E5FF) and magenta (#FF3B9C) used sparingly for buttons and metrics to provide a neon retro feel.
- Text: Light grey (#F0F0F0) for readability against the dark background.
- Font: 'Inter', sans-serif, for body text, providing a modern and clean feel.
- Font: 'Space Grotesk', sans-serif, for headlines and short text, enhancing the retro-tech aesthetic.
- CRT/terminal-inspired layout with modern spacing to ensure a clean and navigable user interface.
- Grid Noise: Add a soft grid noise to the background to simulate a CRT screen effect.
- Text Glitch: Subtle text 'glitch' effect at the hero headline on hover to add a retro touch.
- Micro-fade: Implement a micro-fade animation on project cards to indicate interactivity.
- Typing Animation: Integrate a typed cursor animation inside the terminal to simulate real-time typing.
- Minimal Icons: Use simple, geometric icons to maintain a clean and consistent visual language.
